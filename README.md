Streams are critical components of global elemental cycles by processing dissolved and
particulate matter through microbial metabolism. However, as most research is conducted at
local and regional scales, predicting microbial metabolism in streams at broader spatial scales
remains challenging. In this study, we used data from the National Ecological Observatory
Network program to investigate whether ecological relationships among microbial
community structure and function and environmental conditions observed at small scales
hold at the subcontinental scale. We found that microbial communities were best explained
by site-specific conditions. However, when field replicates were averaged, stream physico-
chemical characteristics such as pH and temperature emerged as driving factors. This
indicates that water quality acted as an environmental filter on microbial communities at the
subcontinental scale, but masked by small-scale patches that created high spatial
heterogeneity. Our findings underscore the importance of considering multiple spatial scales
to fully understand benthic microbial communities’ role in stream biogeochemistry.
